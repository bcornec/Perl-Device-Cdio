2012-04-16  r <rocky@gnu.org>

	* Build.PL, examples/cdtext.pl, lib/Device/Cdio/Track.pm,
	swig/cdtext_old.swg, t/05.ops.t, t/10.cdtext.t: swig/cdtext_old.swg:
	Make this work on libcdio 0.83.  10.cdtext.t: Remove warnings caused
	by version compatiblity.  Track.pm: Add get_cdtext when we have a
	track object.  Build.PL: Need libcdio 0.83 or greater 0.82 won't do.
	chmod +x

2012-04-15  R. Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* MANIFEST, t/10.cdtext.t, t/cdtext.toc: Add CD-Text test case

	* swig/disc.swg, swig/perlcdio.swg, swig/types.swg: Revise CD-Text
	to handle Leon Merten Lohse's new CD-Text interface.  This patch is
	from Leon.

2012-03-10  R. Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* swig/device.swg, swig/device_const.swg, swig/disc.swg: Revise to
	tolerate recent libcdio incompatibilities (those after version

2012-01-18  R. Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* lib/Device/Cdio/ISO9660.pm, lib/Device/Cdio/ISO9660/FS.pm,
	lib/Device/Cdio/ISO9660/IFS.pm, swig/perliso9660.swg, t/07.iso1.t: 
	Add Device::Cdio::ISO9660::IFS::find_lsn. Had already same routine

2011-11-13  R. Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* Makefile: Add installdeps target

2011-10-28  R. Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* Build.PL, lib/Device/Cdio.pm: Replace a couple of "exit"s with
	"die "OS supported"

2011-10-16  R. Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* Build.PL: More administrivia because Build.PL has changed a bit.

2011-10-16  R. Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* MANIFEST, MANIFEST.SKIP, META.yml, swig/perlmmc.swg: Get ready for
	release 0.3.0. Mostly administrivia. perlmmc.swg: match up

2011-10-16  R. Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* .gitignore, Makefile: Administrivia

2011-09-05  R. Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

2011-08-25  R. Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* THANKS, examples/README, examples/checkcd.pl, lib/Device/Cdio.pm,
	lib/Device/Cdio/Device.pm, lib/Device/Cdio/Track.pm,
	swig/device.swg, swig/perlmmc.swg, swig/track.swg: Add
	$track->get_track_isrc. Commit changes to return array ref or array
	based on wantarray. DeviceList_t maps to returning an array
	reference rather than an array. Change all due to jerry geiger.

2011-08-21  r <rocky@gnu.org>

	* examples/checkcd.pl: Guard against uninitialized variables which
	sometimes means we are trying to do a operation in a situation where
	it can't be done.

2011-08-21  r <rocky@gnu.org>

	* MANIFEST: More administrivia: Add new files to MANIFEST.

2011-08-20  R. Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* examples/checkcd.pl: Array return values are now via Array
	references, the OO layer may convert these to arrays if desired. Add
	program to show properties of a CD, e.g. cd type (Audio, ISO-9660,
	UDF). All of this is from jerry geiger.

2011-08-15  R. Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* THANKS, lib/Device/Cdio.pm, lib/Device/Cdio/Device.pm,
	swig/device.swg, swig/disc.swg, swig/perlcdio.swg, swig/read.swg: 
	Jerry G Geiger fixed the C routines that return char** so they
	return a Perl list. He also added cdio_guess_cd_type and
	cdio_read_pvd.

2011-08-14  R. Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* t/11.dev.t: 11.dev.t: Get device name via
	driver_id=>$perlcdio::DRIVER_DEVICE since  Device::Cdio::get_devices
	is borked. Thanks again to Jerry G Geiger for the investigation and
	suggestion.

2011-08-09  R. Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* lib/Device/Cdio/Device.pm, t/11.dev.t: First crack at testing
	audio routines. From Jerry G Geiger.

2011-08-09  R. Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* Build.PL: Slightly more precise test to see if running swig can be
	skipped. Change from Jerry G Geiger.

2011-08-09  R. Bernstein <rocky@cpan.org>

	* Build.PL, META.yml, t/06.bincue.t, t/07.iso.t: Build.PL picks up
	libcdio's CFLAGS now. Correct 07.iso.t test. These changes from
	Jerry G Geiger.  Remove code for pre libcdio 0.77. Versions this far
	back are hopeless.

2011-08-08  r <rocky@gnu.org>

	* .gitignore, META.yml: Another file to ignore

2006-03-02  rocky <rocky>

	* Build.PL, ChangeLog, lib/Device/Cdio/ISO9660.pm,
	lib/Device/Cdio/ISO9660/FS.pm, lib/Device/Cdio/ISO9660/IFS.pm,
	perliso9660.swg, t/07.iso.t: Build.PL: use pkg-config for iso9660.
	Solves the -libiconv problem on cygwin better (and doesn't break
	GNU/Linux).  perliso9660.swg *.pm: remove more of the conditional
	LIBCDIO_VERSION_NUM tests. We'll live with a little more reduced for
	now.  ISO9660.pm: more defensive about short stat arrays.  07.iso.t: typo creaped in.

2006-03-02  rocky <rocky>

	* Build.PL, lib/Device/Cdio/ISO9660/IFS.pm, perliso9660.swg,
	t/07.iso.t: Fixes for stock libcdio 0.76 Some adjustments for cygwin
	(but I'm not sure cygwin's at fault.)

2006-03-02  rocky <rocky>

	* .cvsignore, META.yml: META.yml is derived when making the
	distribution.

2006-03-02  rocky <rocky>

	* examples/iso1.pl, lib/Device/Cdio/ISO9660.pm,
	lib/Device/Cdio/ISO9660/FS.pm, lib/Device/Cdio/ISO9660/IFS.pm,

	lib/Device/Cdio/ISO9660/IFS.pm, perliso9660.swg: Lots of changes to
	get IFS and FS working well enough for the sample programs iso2.pl
	and iso3.pl.  We now return an singleton iso9660stat_t returning data from ISO 9660 reads works.  Removed open and close from @EXPORTS (is in @EXPORTS_OK) as that was
	getting confused with builtin open()/close().

	experience with perlcdio9660.swg.

2006-02-28  rocky <rocky>

	* lib/Device/Cdio/ISO9660/FS.pm: FS class is a subclass of
	Cdio::Device for working with ISO9660 tracks.

2006-02-28  rocky <rocky>

	read.swg, types.swg: More towards getting ISO 9660 working. A number
	of routines added.  read.swg: was not freeing a char * return
	object.

2006-02-26  rocky <rocky>

	* MANIFEST, lib/Device/Cdio.pm, lib/Device/Cdio/Device.pm,
	lib/Device/Cdio/ISO9660/IFS.pm, lib/Device/Cdio/Track.pm,
	perliso9660.swg, t/07.iso.t: More work on the ISO 9660 filesystem
	routines. Add first hint of Perl Package (Device::Cdio::ISO9660) and

2006-02-25  rocky <rocky>

	* Build.PL, device.swg, perliso9660.swg, t/07.iso.t, types.swg: More

	* Build.PL, MANIFEST, perliso9660.swg, t/07.iso.t, types.swg: Looks
	like ISO9660 access for Perl (via libiso9660) will be a reality!

2006-02-24  rocky <rocky>

	* Build.PL, MANIFEST, META.yml, device.swg, lib/Device/Cdio.pm: 
	Version number need to change for CPAN.  Build.PL: a little neater
	perhaps.

	device.swg, lib/Device/Cdio.pm, lib/Device/Cdio/Device.pm,
	lib/Device/Cdio/Track.pm, t/06.bincue.t: Build.PL: we no longer
	require SWIG to be installed. We'll use our own perlcdio_wrap.c if
	not.  device.swg: guard against using a libcdio's get_hwinfo which can
	store outside of the array. It's only a problem in theory as release
	revision numbers are not more than 4 bytes long and the current CVS
	(where the revsion number is 7 bytes long, e.g 0.77cvs) now
	truncates.  *.pm: Synchronize version numbers.  Device.pm: a more useful get_device routine.

2006-02-12  rocky <rocky>

	* t/.gdb_history: Tolerate gdb debugging

2006-02-12  rocky <rocky>

	* device.swg: Possibly a slightly better fix and slightly better
	code.

2006-02-12  rocky <rocky>

	* device.swg: get_hw_info() change for Darwin. Don't know why, but
	static's inside of routine was causing memory to get clobbered. So
	moved it out.  in char ** returns we really need to check that we don't have NULL.  One

	ChangeLogs and code for making them.

2006-02-10  rocky <rocky>

	* device.swg, perlcdio.swg, types.swg: Move word size determination
	from device.swg to types.swg. A better place for it.  perlcdio.swg: document more constants.

	* Build.PL, device.swg: Another hack around word mismatch problem to
	reduce SWIG warnings.

2006-02-10  rocky <rocky>

	* device.swg, examples/README: README: Add cautionary warnings about
	inoperability. Reduce expectations.  device.swg: hack for word size.
	Sigh.
