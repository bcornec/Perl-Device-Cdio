=head1 NAME

Device::Cdio::ISO9660::FS - Class for ISO9660 filesystem reading

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This encapsulates IS9660 filesystem handling. This library however
needs to be used in conjunction with Device::Cdio.

    use Device::Cdio::ISO9660:FS;
    ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is an Perl Object-Oriented interface to the GNU CD Input and
Control library (libcdio) which is written in C. The library
encapsulates CD-ROM reading and control. Perl programs wishing to be
oblivious of the OS- and device-dependent properties of a CD-ROM can
use this library.

The encapsulation is done in two parts. The lower-level Perl
interface is called L<perliso9660> and is generated by SWIG.

The more object-oriented package Device::Cdio::ISO9660 and uses uses
perliso9660. 

Although perliso9660 is perfectly usable on its own, it is expected that
Cdio is what most people will use. As perlcdio more closely models the
C interface, it is conceivable (if unlikely) that die-hard libcdio C
users who are very familiar with that interface could prefer that.

See also L<http://www.gnu/org/software/libcdio/libcdio.html> for more
complete description and
L<http://www.gnu/org/software/libcdio/libcdio.html> of the C library
from which this is based, and
L<http://www.gnu.org/software/libcdio/doxygen/files.html> for API

=head2 CALLING ROUTINES

Routines accept named parameters as well as positional parameters.
For named parameters, each argument name is preceded by a dash. For
example:

    Device::Cdio::ISO9660::FS->new(-source=>'MYISO.ISO')

Each argument name is preceded by a dash.  Neither case nor order
matters in the argument list.  -driver_id, -Driver_ID, and -DRIVER_ID
are all acceptable.  In fact, only the first argument needs to begin
with a dash.  If a dash is present in the first argument, we assume
dashes for the subsequent parameters.

In the documentation below and elsewhere in this package the parameter
name that can be used in this style of call is given in the parameter
list. For example, for "close tray the documentation below reads:

   close_tray(drive=undef, driver_id=$perlcdio::DRIVER_UNKNOWN) 
    -> ($drc, $driver_id)

So the parameter names are "drive", and "driver_id". Neither parameter
is required. If "drive" is not specified, a value of "undef" will be
used. And if "driver_id" is not specified, a value of
$perlcdio::DRIVER_UNKNOWN is used.

The older, more traditional style of positional parameters is also
supported. So the "have_driver example from above can also be written:

    Cdio::have_driver('GNU/Linux')

Finally, since no parameter name can be confused with a an integer,
negative values will not get confused as a named parameter.

=head2 read_pvd

read_pvd()->pvd

Read the Super block of an ISO 9660 image. This is the rimary Volume
Descriptor (PVD) and perhaps a Supplemental Volume Descriptor if
(Joliet) extensions are acceptable.

=cut

sub read_pvd {
    my($self,@p) = @_;
    return 0 if !_check_arg_count($#_, 0);

    # FIXME call new on PVD object
    return perliso9660::fs_read_pvd($self->{cd});
}

=pod

=head2 read_superblock

read_superblock(iso_mask=$libiso9660::EXTENSION_NONE)->bool

Read the Super block of an ISO 9660 image. This is the rimary Volume
Descriptor (PVD) and perhaps a Supplemental Volume Descriptor if
(Joliet) extensions are acceptable.

=cut

sub read_superblock {
    my($self,@p) = @_;
    my($iso_mask) = rearrange(['ISO_MASK'], @p);
    
    $iso_mask = $perliso9660::EXTENSION_NONE if !defined($iso_mask);

    return perliso9660::fs_read_superblock($self->{cd}, $iso_mask);
}

=pod

=head2 stat

stat(path, translate=0)->\%stat

Return file status for path name psz_path. NULL is returned on error.

If translate is 1,  version numbers in the ISO 9660 name are dropped, i.e. ;1
is removed and if level 1 ISO-9660 names are lowercased.

Each item of @iso_stat is a hash reference which contains

=over 4

=item LSN 

the Logical sector number (an integer)

=item size 

the total size of the file in bytes

=item  sec_size 

the number of sectors allocated

=item  filename

the file name of the statbuf entry

=item XA

if the file has XA attributes; 0 if not

=item is_dir 

1 if a directory; 0 if a not;

=back

=cut

    my($self, @p) = @_;
