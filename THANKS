Many thanks to Jerry G Geiger for resurrecting this project from the dead. He added:

- audio_get_volume
- audio_set_volume
- get_disk_cdtext, get_track_cdtext
- audio_get_status
- is_tray_open
- cdio_version (version string of linked library)
- get_cddb_discid
- audio_get_status
- get_joliet_level

He also fixed Build.PL so it works again and added many corrections to
my faulty C interface code.;

Thanks to Mart√≠n Ferrari for making this available on Debian *and* for finding and fixing the bugs needed to do so.
